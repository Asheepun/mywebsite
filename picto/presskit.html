		<h1 id="about-header">Picto - Mixed Reality Puzzle Platformer</h1>
		<p>
			Picto is a mixed reality puzzle game about a video game character who discovers the real world. The goal of the project is to make a deep and interesting mixed reality game that does things that have never been done before, and which anyone can play on their phone.
		</p>

		<p>
				The game will feature many different mechanics which let both realities interact with each other in different ways. One example of this is that dark pixels in the cameras input image can turn into walkable terrain. Another one is that blue pixels can turn into water particles, which then pour out in a physically based fluid simulation.

		<h2>Story</h2>
		<p>
				The game's story will be created with a technique which I call "first principles storytelling", which basically means that instead of forcing a story onto the game, you observe what's actually happening in the simulation, and let the game tell it's own story. In this particular game, an objective truth is that the reality of the game is being mixed with a much greater outside reality, that contains greater beings (humans) who control what happens in the game's world.
			<br>
			<br>
				What does this mean for the characters in the game? What are they experiencing and how do they feel about it? What religions do they believe in and what scientific advances have they made? Lot's of clues about the story will be found in the game's environment, but the plan is to also add different NPCs that can be talked to and who represent different religious, scientific and philosophical beliefs.
			<br>
			<br>
				My ambition with Picto is to create something which has never been seen before, and which hopefully will have an impact on the field of game design as a whole and move it towards new and interesting directions.
