		<h1>Your Story (Full Answer)</h1>

BOND is an evolution of the classic Sokoban puzzle game genre that introduces new and fresh game mechanics that challenge the player’s creativity and problem-solving ability. The core point of the game is to provide as many “eureka moments” as possible, where the player comes to rewarding realizations in almost every level.
<br>
<br>
The reason that the puzzles give this experience is due to the way the game was designed. I took a lot of inspiration from the ideas pioneered by Jonathan Blow when he designed the puzzle games Braid and The Witness. His approach to game design has been called “Designing to reveal the nature of the universe”, which maybe sounds pretentious, but in practice it boils down to trying to figure out all of the interesting things that can happen with your game’s mechanics, and presenting your findings to the player in the form of puzzles.
<br>
<br>
A concrete example of how I used this design approach in BOND is when I added cloners to the game. Cloners let you make copies of other objects, and after playing around with them for a while I figured out that if I made a lot of copies of a stone-block I could build a bridge out of them. This realization led to the design of a level where a wide gap is blocking the player from reaching the goal, and the only things that they have on their side of the gap is a stone-block and a cloner. To solve the level, the player needs to figure out the same thing that I figured out when I designed the level, which is that they can build a bridge to cross the gap if they clone the stone-block enough times. This feels like a true discovery for the player, because it actually was a true discovery for me when I designed the level. All 64 levels in the game have been designed this way, and they take the player through a journey of discovery and surprise, which is a polished version of the same journey that I went through when designing the game, and which contains all of the “eureka moments” that I personally experienced.

<br>
During the game’s development I have been studying at Lund University, and taken courses in physics, filosophy, psychology and math. This has given me a broad perspective of how people in different scientific fields think, and I’ve found an interesting similarity between solving puzzles in BOND and high level mathematics. The way a mathematician has to reason about an abstract object and try to figure out its applications and consequences is very similar to how players have to reason about this game’s mechanics, and figure out how they can be utilized. The difference however, is that high level math is very inaccessible and difficult, whilst I’ve worked very hard to make BOND as approachable as possible. All visuals and UI elements have been polished until they sparkle, and the difficulty of the levels has been tuned very carefully. The game is covered by a beautiful music score, composed by Dennis Qvarfordt, who also designed all of the incredibly satisfying sound effects. Many playtesters have commented that it’s addicting to simply walk around in the game due to how nice everything feels.

The reason I’m filling out this form and asking to be featured on the App Store is simple, it’s because I believe that BOND can provide a very valuable and rich experience to a lot of people. This game lets people get into the abstract mindset of a mathematician, forcing them to think both logically and outside of the box, whilst making the experience feel like a leisure activity that they will want to do in their free time. I also want to be able to make more games like this in the future, and all the money that I earn from BOND is going to be spent on creating more unique games that provide interesting and thoughtful experiences to people.
